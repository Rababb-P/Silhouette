We utilised Generative AI to build this project (ChatGPT, Github CoPilot, Claude, Cursor)

We also utilised Overshoot API and it's docs. 

Our main IDE in this project was DevSwarm! Using their parrallel AI agent workflows, we were able to get multiple branches of our intial site (frontend, backend) working at once with different AI agents. We then later used DevSwarms multiple workflows to create different reasoning versions of our AI agent and tested to find the best version! Overall, DevSwarm was vital to our project and workflow.
